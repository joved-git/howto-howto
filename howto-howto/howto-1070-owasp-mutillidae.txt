the existing version can be updated on these platforms. With dozens of vulnerabilities and hints to guide the user, 
Mutillidae provides an accessible web hacking environment suitable for labs, security enthusiasts, classrooms, CTFs, and 
vulnerability assessment tool targets. It has been widely used in graduate security courses, corporate web security training,
and as an assessment target for vulnerability assessment software. OWASP Mutillidae II provides a comprehensive platform for 
learning and practicing web security techniques in a controlled environment.This is an easy to use integrated penetration

-> Open the vulnerable site
Mutillidae should be installed in Metasploitable.
On Kali, open http://<Metasploitable IP> then choose Mutillidae or directly open http://<Metasploitable IP>/mutillidae

-> Look at primary information
On the first line, you should see some interesting information:
  -Version: 2.1.19                    : the version of the tool.
  -Security Level: 0 (Hosed)          : the level of the security (0 means no secured at all).
  -Hints: Disabled (0 - I try harder) : no hint available.
  -Not Logged In                      : not yet connected or no account created.

-> Toogle Hints and/or Security level
Just below, you can find buttons (Toggle Hints / Toggle Security) used to change these parameters (try it).

-> Try an injection
1. Choose on the left OWASP Top 10/A1 - Injection / SQLi Extract Data / User info
2. Try admin/admin
  If you have an error message "metasploit.account" table doesn't exist", do that:
    On the Metasploitable machine:
    $ sudo nano /var/www/mutillidae/config.inc then change the dbname:
    ---
    dbname='owasp10';
    ---
3. Put "admin" in Name and a "'" in Password. Click "View Account Details". You will see all that you shouldn't.
  The Message used to find possible injection (Google)     |
  The SQL request                                          |
  Name of the tabme, name of a column                      | -> very useful information to be hacked /!\
  The filename and the concerned line                      |

4. Put "admin" in Name and "badpwd' OR 1=1 #" in Password. Click "View Account Details". You will see all account details !!!
  The final request is: SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username='admin' AND password='badpwd' OR 1=1'
