Threat Intelligence (TI) | Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) 

Threat Intelligence, or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), is a discipline based on 
intelligence techniques, which aims to collect and organize all information related 
to cyber threats (cyber attacks), in order to draw up a portrait of attackers or 
highlight trends (affected sectors of activity, method used, etc.). This profiling 
allows for better defense and to better anticipate different incidents by allowing 
detection at the beginning of a large-scale attack (APT).
