Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
#BASICS

The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is one of Nmap's most powerful and flexible features. It allows users to write 
(and share) simple scripts (using the Lua programming language ) to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. 
Those scripts are executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap. Users can rely on the 
growing and diverse set of scripts distributed with Nmap, or write their own to meet custom needs.

Tasks we had in mind when creating the system include network discovery, more sophisticated version detection, 
vulnerability detection. NSE can even be used for vulnerability exploitation.

To reflect those different uses and to simplify the choice of which scripts to run, each script contains a field 
associating it with one or more categories. Currently defined categories are auth, broadcast, default. discovery, 
dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. These are all described in the 
section called “Script Categories”.

Scripts are not run in a sandbox and thus could accidentally or maliciously damage your system or invade your 
privacy. Never run scripts from third parties unless you trust the authors or have carefully audited the scripts 
yourself. * Nmap script are written in LUA language.

* With scripts, you can find services more precicely, detect vulnerabilities, discover backdoor, 
  make dos and crack pws for example.

* Go the https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts.

* Launch a script (example).
$ sudo nmap --script ftp-vsftp-backdoor -p 21 <host>

$ sudo nmap --script ftp-vsftp-backdoor -p 21 <host>           -> a particular script
$ sudo nmap --script "http-*"  -p 80 <host>                    -> a list of scriptq (here, all those begin with http-)
$ sudo nmap --script "not dos" <host>                          -> all script except those with dos

                                                               -> add args to the script
$ sudo nmap --script http-virustotal --script-args='http-virustoatl.apikey="KEY", http-virustotal.filename="file"'

# Update the script database
$ sudo nmap --scrpt-updatedb

# Example - Find vulnerabilities on Metasploitable
