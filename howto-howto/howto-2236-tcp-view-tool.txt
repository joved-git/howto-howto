TCPView

TCPView is a Windows program that displays detailed lists of all TCP and UDP 
endpoints on your system, including local and remote addresses and TCP 
connection status. TCPView also shows the name of the process that owns the 
endpoint. TCPView provides a more informative and easily presented subset of 
the Netstat program that ships with Windows. The TCPView download includes 
TCPvcon, a command line version with the same functionality.
