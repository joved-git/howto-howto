Airodump-ng is used for packet capture, capturing raw 802.11 frames. It is particularly suitable 
for collecting WEP IVs (Initialization Vector) or WPA handshakes for the intent of using them 
with aircrack-ng. If you have a GPS receiver connected to the computer, airodump-ng is capable 
of logging the coordinates of the found access points.

Additionally, airodump-ng writes out several files containing the details of all access points 
and clients seen, which can be used for scripting, or creating custom tools

# Find your interface name.
$ iwconfig

# Wifi observation
$ sudo airodump-ng wlan0

# Wifi capture
$ sudo airodump-ng --bssid <MAC> -w capture wlan0mon

That create a capture-nn.cap file.

# Use Wireshark to observe Packets
   -Edit/Preferences/Protocol/IEEE 802.11
   -You could click on "Enable Encryption" then "Decryption keys" to give a wpa-mwd key.
   -File/Open the capture-nn.cap file.

If you want to prepare packets for a better decryption by Wireshark, use airdcap-ng:
$ sudo airdecap-ng -e <ESSID> -p <password> <capturefile.cap>
$ sudo airdecap-ng --help            (if nedded)

You obtain a <capturefile-dec.cap> file. You can re-open it with Wireshark.
