Airodump-ng is used for packet capture, capturing raw 802.11 frames. It is particularly suitable 
for collecting WEP IVs (Initialization Vector) or WPA handshakes for the intent of using them 
with aircrack-ng. If you have a GPS receiver connected to the computer, airodump-ng is capable 
of logging the coordinates of the found access points.

Additionally, airodump-ng writes out several files containing the details of all access points 
and clients seen, which can be used for scripting, or creating custom tools

# Find your interface name.
$ iwconfig

# Wifi observation
$ sudo airodump-ng wlan0

The result:

CH  5 ][ Elapsed: 7 mins ][ 2025-01-24 04:13 ][ interface wlan0 down

With:

BSSID: MAC of acces points                    |   PWR: power of the signal (-78 is better than -95)
Beacons: number of identification broadcast   |   #Data: quantity of data
         packets                              |   #/s: quantity of data per second
CH (channel): the wifi channel                |   MB: max speed
ENC: type of encryption                       |   CIPHER/AUTH: info on encryption algorithm
ESSID: name of the access point               |
# Wifi capture
$ sudo airodump-ng --bssid <MAC> -w capture wlan0

You could add a channel to optimize capture.
$ sudo airodump-ng --bssid <MAC> c <channel #> -w capture wlan0

That create a capture-nn.cap file.

# Use Wireshark to observe Packets
   -Edit/Preferences/Protocol/IEEE 802.11
   -You could click on "Enable Encryption" then "Decryption keys" to give a wpa-mwd key.
   -File/Open the capture-nn.cap file.

If you want to prepare packets for a better decryption by Wireshark, use airdcap-ng:
$ sudo airdecap-ng -e <ESSID> -p <password> <capturefile.cap>
$ sudo airdecap-ng --help            (if nedded)

You obtain a <capturefile-dec.cap> file. You can re-open it with Wireshark.
