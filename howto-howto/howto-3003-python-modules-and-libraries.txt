Pyhton's modules and libraries
#BASICS

In the Python programming language, module is a simple file that contains collections 
of global variables and functions with a. py extension file. It is an executable file 
that can be imported into another Python program.

In Python, a library therefore designates a software set of modules (constants, 
functions, classes) adding extended possibilities to the language. This function allows 
the developer to share reusable code in their community.

The library brings together functionalities that can be reused several times to develop 
a project in the Python language.

See: https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

-> Presentation of https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html
Search for a module and explore it.
You will see packets with related modules:
  Example: urllib	
               urllib.error	Exception classes raised by urllib.request.
               urllib.parse	Parse URLs into or assemble them from components.
               urllib.request	Extensible library for opening URLs.
               urllib.response	Response classes used by urllib.

-> Use pip to install external modules
Under the name of your Project, you should find "External libraries". Click to open
  and find "Site-packages" then "pip". 

Under Pycharm, open the Terminal then type these commands:
$ pip install <module>
$ pip uninstall <module>
>>> the <module> could be import now in your Python code.
Example:
$ pip install python-pdf then return to "External libraries / Site-packages".
>>> you should see the python-pdf lib as "pydf".
