Ettercap is a comprehensive suite for man in the middle attacks. It features sniffing of live connections, 
content filtering on the fly and many other interesting tricks. It supports active and passive dissection 
of many protocols and includes many features for network and host analysis.

-> How to do a Man In the Middle Attack
1. Active the ip_forwarding on Kali.
  $ sudo bash -c "echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

2. Configure Ettercap.
Change the ec_uid and the ec_gid to avoid permission problems.
  $ sudo vi /etc/ethercap/etter.conf
  ---
  ec_uid 0 # 65534                     # nobody is the default
  ec_gid 0 # 65534                     # nobody is the default
  ---

3. Launch the graphical interface of Ettercap.
  $ sudo ettercap -G

4. Use Ettercap.
Click on Accept on the up right (the little V).
On the left, you will find the Host list icon. Click on it to see local machine.
To see all machines, click on the 3 vertical dots icons on the right, then "Hosts" and "Scan for hosts".
You should see new machines (Metasploitable and Win10).
Define the 2 targets machines (Metasploitable and Win10).
On the right, click on the World (MITM Menu) then choose "ARP poisoning".
Check that "Sniff remote connections" is checked then click OK.
Go to the 3-dot menu then choose "Logging" then "Logging all packets and info". Choose a file name (logmitm) 
  on the Kali's Desktop (you should go to /home/kali/Desktop).

5. Install Putty on the Windows machine.
On Windows, download and install Putty.

6. Execute a connection between Win-10 and Metasploitable.
Use Putty, choose Telnet and put the ip address of Metasploitable.
Log to Metasploitable with msfadmin/msfadmin.

7. Check the logs.
Launch another Term.
See the logs by:
  $ sudo etterlog ~/Desktop/logmitm.eci			-> Generic data
  $ sudo etterlog ~/Desktop/logmitm.ecp			-> Data exchanged between the 2 machines.
