Null Byte Injection (Premature End of String)
#BASICS

Null Byte Injection is a serious attack that consists of polluting the input of a website 
(often via URL) with a misplaced end of string, to divert its operation.

As with the arbitrary code injection attack, the vulnerability to Null Byte Injection 
occurs when the inputs are not filtered. The hacker then abuses this trust and aspires 
to have confidential information that he is not authorized to approach.

The attack is forged based on the special character that represents an end of string. 
When this character is URL encoded it becomes %00. Its presence in the string 
immediately terminates it at the place of its declaration. 

For example, if a string received via the URL has the value Hel%00lo, then the actual 
string that will be processed at runtime is "Hel". The presence of %00 terminates the 
string prematurely.

-> Handle double "%00" parsing
If you have an URL that firstly parses the "%00" then the server again, you have to use a 
trick concerning that "%00": hide the first "%" with its code, that is "%25". So the code
you have to inject into the URL should be "%2500".

-> What can we do whit Null Byte Injection
Stop code everywhere.
It is possible to stop the code exactly when we want. For example, if a site constructs
an URL by adding .html to the ?p=index parameter, it is possible to look at another type
of file by adding %00 at the end of the URL. 
  ?p=index points to index.html file
  ?p=admin.php points to admin.php.html
  ?p=admin.php%00 points to admin.php

-> How to prevent yourself from Null Byte Injection
At the PHP code level:
  -Avoid to include all pages of the website in the home page at the user's request.
  -If you still want to work this way, filter the entries and exclude special characters 
   like "%". 
  -Define the list of all page names that may be called.
