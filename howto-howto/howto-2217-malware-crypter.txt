Crypter

A crypter is a type of software that can encrypt, obfuscate, and manipulate 
malware, to make it harder to detect by security programs. It is used by 
cybercriminals to create malware that can bypass security programs by 
presenting itself as a harmless program until it gets installed.

-> Types of crypters
A crypter contains a crypter stub, or a code used to encrypt and decrypt 
malicious code. Depending on the type of stub they use, crypters can be 
classified as either static/statistical or polymorphic.

  -Static/statistical crypters use different stubs to make each encrypted 
   file unique. Having a separate stub for each client makes it easier 
   for malicious actors to modify or, in hacking terms, “clean” a stub 
   once it has been detected by a security software.

  -Polymorphic crypters are considered more advanced. They use 
   state-of-the-art algorithms that utilize random variables, data, keys, 
   decoders, and so on. As such, one input source file never produces an 
   output file that is identical to the output of another source file.

-> How crypters spread malicious code
Here are some technics
  -Cybercriminals create crypters or buy them on underground markets.
  -They use crypters to encrypt a malicious program then reassemble the 
   code into an actual working program.
  -They send these programs as part of an attachment in spear phishing 
   emails and spammed messages.
  -Unknowing users open the program, which will force the crypter to 
   decrypt itself and then release the malicious code.
