A Trojan is a software that is used to hide another software. The inner software
is called "payload". This payload could be a backdoor, a virus, a keylogger or
a RAT (Remote Administration Tool). All is possible.

The Trojan is just a transporter for the malicious soft and is often seen as
proper and fair.

-> Different types of Trojan
-in IRC: a infected machine open a chanel, share it with the victim and pilot it.
-in http: the payload is just a tiny web server that just open a mini web site.
          The hacker could launch some commands using this website.
-mobile's trojan.
-binder: the binder hides other programs inside itself and is able to execute 
         them as needed. Very difficult to detect. There is so many Binders,
         that automatically creates the safe soft with malicious others inside.
         When you starts the "safe" soft, the malicieous also starts.

-> Easy to create a Keylogger
By using a Binder, you could create a Trojan very easily.

-> How to prevent
Some technics to detect Trojans.
  -Make a scan with the anti-virus.
  -Observe the network activity.
  -Compare the hash of safe softwares.  Virustotal (www.virustotal.com) could do 
   that for you.
  -Keep aware (scan before use, don't trust anything).
