Basic use of the SET (Social Engineer Toolkit)
#BASICS

SET is a tool for automating social engineering techniques. We will see how to use it.
First of all, you can launch it by going to Kali, in the “Applications -> Operations Tools -> Social Engineer Toolkit” menu.

Simply type the number in question to access a menu, or “99” to exit.
For example, you can select “1” to go to “Social-Engineering Attacks” then “2” to select “Website Attack Vectors”.
You will find several attacks that we saw in the videos:

selecting for example "1" ("Java Applet Attack Method"), SET will create a site (either a copy of an existing site, or a 
predefined template) and add the malicious applet to take control of the target.
The site will be located in the ~.set/web_clone folder, and the Java warning will launch when launching the site:

Of course, you will then need to configure various parameters, such as the IP address which will receive the connections 
(handler)…etc.

The idea here is to observe that it is easy to create tailor-made attacks. All the more reason to protect yourself from 
social engineering attacks, because the hacker will not necessarily need to be a technical expert.
