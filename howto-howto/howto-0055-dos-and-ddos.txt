A denial of service attack (abbreviated as DoS attack) is a computer attack aimed at making a service 
unavailable and preventing legitimate users of a service from using it. Currently the vast majority of 
these attacks are carried out from several sources, we then speak of a distributed denial of service 
attack (abbr. DDoS attack for Distributed Denial of Service attack).

This could be:
    -Flooding a network to prevent it from functioning.
    -The disruption of connections between two machines, preventing access to a particular service.
    -Obstructing access to a service for a particular person.
    -The fact of sending billions of bytes to an internet box.

A denial of service attack can block a file server, make access to a web server impossible or prevent 
the distribution of email within a company.

The attacker does not necessarily need sophisticated equipment. Thus, some DoS attacks can be executed 
with limited resources against a larger, more modern network. This type of attack is sometimes called 
an “asymmetric attack” because of the difference in resources between the protagonists.

-> Types of DoS
There are 2 types of denies:
  -DoS: simple DoS: only one source for the attack.
  -DDoS for Distributed DoS: attack made by several sources.

-> Ways to execute a DoS
There are 2 ways of denies:
  -On line: via the wen site.
  -Off line: via ransomwares.

-> Attack by amplifaction
The attacker makes a big request (ie a big file) to a server but redirect response to the victim.
The victim will be busy processing the large file.

-> Network attack
  -TCP SYN flood. Based on the 3-way handshake (see howto-0057-three-way-handshake.txt).
  -Smurf (ICMP) flood.
  -UDP flood.
  -ARP flood.
  -DNS reflexion.
  -Wireless network.

-> An example with HPing
1. Launch a Windows machine and the Task manager.

2 Go to Kali and use hping:
  $ hping3 <win10 ip> --flood -S -p 445 -d 1200
    --flood: sent packets as fast as possible. Don't show replies.
    -S: for TCP SYN
    -p <port>
    -d <size of data>

  You will see the CPU grows to 35% (initally, it was at 5%) and the Ethernet grows to 100%.

-> How to prevent
Some ways:
  -This is not easy but not impossible.
  -Try to reduce the impact with design: filtering, priority managing, blocking.
  -Try to reduce the impact with operational: check ip address, malicious traffic detection.
  -Use mitigation service: Cloudfare, OVH, ...
