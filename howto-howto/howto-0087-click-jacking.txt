Clickjacking
#BASICS

Clickjacking is a malicious technique aimed at tricking an Internet user into providing confidential 
information or taking control of their computer by forcing them to click on apparently safe pages.

-> How that works
No matter where you click on the page, you will automatically click on a button or underlying link.
Click-Jacking is difficult to spot because it is possible to make it completely invisible.

-> How to prevent yourself
Here are some advice:
  -Authorize the use of .htaccess files. Edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf the modify that part:
  ---
  <Directory /var/www/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
  </Directory>
  ---
  >>> Change "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All.

  -To protect your own website from Click-Jacking and thus prevent someone from placing your site 
   in an iframe to make you click and perform specific actions, you can define the X-Frame-Options 
   option in Apache.
   Rem: An iframe is an HTML element tht allows inclusion of a site in another one.
  --- file .htaccess ---
  ...
  # Anti Clickjacking
  Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
