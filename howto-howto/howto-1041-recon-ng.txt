Recon-ng
#BASICS

Among the tools designed to facilitate passive recognition, Recon-ng stands out as a powerful and flexible platform. 
Developed in Python, Recon-ng provides a framework similar to that of Metasploit, offering an easy-to-use interface 
for launching specific recognition modules.

These modules allow users to automatically collect valuable data about domains, IP addresses, people, social media 
accounts, and more, all without sending a single packet directly to the target.

Recon-ng is designed to be modular, allowing the community to contribute new modules that extend its recognition 
capabilities. From email collection to subdomain identification and beyond, Recon-ng automates the information 
collection process and organizes the collected data into an internal database for easy analysis.

This makes it a valuable tool for security professionals looking to perform comprehensive reconnaissance without 
arousing suspicion.

$ recon-ng
>>> Gives the prompt.

> help <cmd>
>>> Gives information on <cmd>.

> marketplace install all
>>> Install all modules.

> modules search
>>> Displays modules by categories.
    Discovery, Exploitation, Import, Recon and Reporting.
    
> modules load <module>
>>> load <module> (!!! Give complet path, example: discovery/info_disclosure/cache_snoop)

> options list
>>> Displays options for the current module.

> info
>>> Displays complete information on the loaded module.

> options set <option> <value>
>>> Set a <value> for an <option>.

> run
>>> Starts module

> back
>>> Quits/unloads the module.

> exit
>>> Quits recon-ng.

Some examples:
-> discovery/info_disclosure/cache_snoop: gives info from DNS cache.
-> discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files: used to retrieve interesting files.
    Try with: > options set PORT 443
              > options set PROTOCOL https
              > options set SOURCE www.leblogduhacker.fr
              > run
-> recon/hosts-hosts/virustotal: find info by asking the database Virustotal (domains linked to an IP address).
    Go to https://www.virustotal.com/gui/
    Create account (Signed up) then go to your Account/API keys and copy the key.
    Try with: > keys add virustotal_api <the copied key>
              > options set SOURCE <ip>
              > run
