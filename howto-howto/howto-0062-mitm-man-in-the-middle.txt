Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), sometimes called monster-in-the-middle attack1,2 or man-in-the-middle attack, 
Intermediary attack is an attack aimed at intercepting communications between two parties, without either 
party being able to suspect that the communication channel between them has been hijacked.

The most common channel is a connection to the Internet of the average Internet user. The attacker must first 
be able to observe and intercept messages from one victim to another. The “man in the middle” attack is found 
more particularly in the context of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, when this exchange is used without 
authentication. With authentication, Diffie-Hellman, on the other hand, is invulnerable to eavesdropping on 
the channel, and is also designed for this.

-> Goal
Here are some explanations:
  -Intercepte communication between 2 parties.
  -The attacker is in the middle of the conversation.
  -The attacker intercepte traffic then resend it.

-> The way of working
  -The attacker must use the ARP spoofing.
  -The tool for that is ettercap.

-> How to do a Man In the Middle Attack
1. Active the ip_forwarding on Kali.
  $ sudo sh
  # echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

2. Configure Ettercap.
Change the ec_uid and the ec_gid to avoid permission problems.
  $ sudo vi /etc/ethercap/etter.conf
  ---
  ec_uid 0 # 65534                     # nobody is the default
  ec_gid 0 # 65534                     # nobody is the default
  ---

3. Launch the graphical interface of Ettercap.
  $ sudo ettercap -G

4. Use Ettercap.
  -Click on Accept on the up right (the little V).
  -On the left, you will find the Host list icon. Click on it to see local machine.
  -To see all machines, click on the 3 vertical dots icons on the right, then "Hosts" and "Scan for hosts".
  -You should see new machines (Metasploitable and Win10).
  -Define the 2 targets machines (Metasploitable and Win10).
  -On the right, click on the World (MITM Menu) then choose "ARP poisoning".
  -Check that "Sniff remote connections" is checked then click OK.
  -Go to the 3-dot menu then choose "Logging" then "Logging all packets and info". Choose a file name (logmitm) 
    on the Kali's Desktop (you should go to /home/kali/Desktop).

5. Install Putty on the Windows machine.
On Windows, download and install Putty.

6. Execute a connection between Win-10 and Metasploitable.
  -Use Putty, choose Telnet and put the ip address of Metasploitable.
  -Log to Metasploitable with msfadmin/msfadmin.

7. Check the logs.
  -Launch another Term.
  -See the logs by:
  $ sudo etterlog ~/Desktop/logmitm.eci			-> Generic data
  $ sudo etterlog ~/Desktop/logmitm.ecp			-> Data exchanged between the 2 machines.
