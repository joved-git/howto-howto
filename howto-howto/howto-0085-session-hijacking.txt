Session hijacking (sometimes called cookie hijacking, TCP session hijacking, or packet sniffing) 
occurs when a hacker takes control of your Internet session. Such a situation can happen when you 
are shopping online, paying a bill or checking your bank balance. Session hijackers usually target 
browsers or Internet applications, and their aim is to control your browsing session to access 
your personal information as well as passwords.

Session hijackers pretend to be you to websites. This type of attack can have serious consequences 
for application security because it allows hackers to gain unauthorized access to protected 
accounts (and the data they contain) by pretending to be a legitimate user .

-> Goal
Take control of the session between machine.
Allow access to a service without any authentification.
Use protocole vulnerabilities.

-> How to make a session hijacking
1. Establish a MITM connection between 2 machines with ettercap (see howto-0053-ettercap.txt).

2. Retrieve and install Shijack
Go to https://packetstorm.news/files/id/24657/ and download Shijack.

3. Find the source port used by the machine.
Launch Wireshark, open a session then filter by "telnet".
Make some traffic between Win-10 and Metasploitable by making some "ls" into the telnet session.
You will find the source port (on Win-10). For example: 49776

4. Use Shijack to hijack the session.
$ sudo ./shijack-lnx eth0 <win10 ip> <win10 port = 49776> <Metasploitable ip> <telnet port = 23>
Wait for connexion: Waiting for SEQ/ACK  to arrive from the srcip to the dstip
Make some traffic ("ls") from Win-10 machine via telnet.
Look for "Got packet message" and Starting hijack session, Please use ^C to terminate messages on shikack.

Now, all what you type into te shijack window will be executed on the Metasploitable machine.
Try:
 mkdir pirate

The directory should be created on the Metasploitable machine under /home/msfadmin.

-> How to prevent
1. Make cookies and session ID expire faster.
2. Use HTTPS/SSL.
3. Avoid multiple snd simultaneous sessions.
4. Avoid session numbers too easy to find.
5. Don(t put session ID into GET veriables.
6. Use new session ID on each request.
