Session hijacking (sometimes called cookie hijacking, TCP session hijacking, or packet sniffing) 
occurs when a hacker takes control of your Internet session. Such a situation can happen when you 
are shopping online, paying a bill or checking your bank balance. Session hijackers usually target 
browsers or Internet applications, and their aim is to control your browsing session to access 
your personal information as well as passwords.

Session hijackers pretend to be you to websites. This type of attack can have serious consequences 
for application security because it allows hackers to gain unauthorized access to protected 
accounts (and the data they contain) by pretending to be a legitimate user .

-> Goal
Take control of the session between machine.
Allow access to a service without any authentification.
Use protocole vulnerabilities.

-> How to make a session jacking
1. Connect the 2 machines with ettercap (see howto-0053-ettercap.txt).

2. Retreive and install Shijack
Go to https://packetstorm.news/files/id/24657/ and download Shijack.

3. Find the source port used by the machine.
Launch Wireshark, open a session then filter by "telnet".
Make some traffic between Win-10 and Metasploitable by making some "ls" into the telnet session.
You will find the source port (on Win-10). For example: 49776
3. Use Shijack
