Basics:
-> Use to learn everything about the target (who, what, where, when and how ?).
-> To establish an ID of the target.
-> It uses active identification (onto the place) or passive one (via internet or without 
   interaction).

About techniques (large sens):
-> Internet (whois, legal mentions, ...)
-> Internet but more technical (IP address, used technicals, ...)
-> Off line (catalogues, documents, ...) 
-> Off line but more direct (dumpster diving, trash and bin, shoulder surfing, eaves dropping, ...)

Techniques and tools (pratically):

-> Google hacking: find information very thinly. !!! Use Advances search !!!
-> Boardreader (www.boardreader.com): search into forum and discussion sites.
-> Shodan (www.shodan.io) : to find connected equipements and easily metadata. !!! Use filters !!!
-> TinEye: to find sites from images/photos..
-> nslookup/dig: to retrieve information from a host name.
-> Use one email to find accesses to multiple sites.  
-> whois (www.whois.com/whois): used to retrieve public information concerning a web site.
-> urlscan (www.urlscan.io) is used to scan a domain name and extract information (linked IP 
   addresses and details, domain names, HTTP scripts and source codes, images, behaviours, cookies,
   indicators, ...
-> viewdns.info (viwdns.info): used to find DNS, whois, ..., requests and reverse's ones.
-> Censys (search.censys.io) and CRT (crt.sh): search for certificates.
-> traceroute and ping tools: location and path to reach a machine.
-> Use of https://www.iplocation.net: IP address location.
-> Use of https://web.archive.org: archive all sites before very long time (go back).
-> Maltego: collects and analyse data and construct links between entities (graphical tool).
-> recon-ng: command line tool used to automate identification tasks.
