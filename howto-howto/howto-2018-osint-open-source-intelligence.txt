OSINT | Open Source Intelligence
#BASICS

OSINT (for Open Source Intelligence) is the way to use internet to retrieve 
public information. Concretely, we use internet and physical documents to 
obtain thin public information about a target (in the cases of attack or 
pentesting) and/or about ourself (in the case of protection).
