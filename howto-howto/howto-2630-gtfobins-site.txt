GTFOBins
#BASICS

GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local 
security restrictions in misconfigured systems.

The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused 
to get the f**k break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated 
privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate 
the other post-exploitation tasks.

It is important to note that this is not a list of exploits, and the programs 
listed here are not vulnerable theirselves. 

GTFOBins is rather a compendium about how to live off the land when you only 
have certain binaries available.
