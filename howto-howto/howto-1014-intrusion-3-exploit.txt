Basics:
-> This is the key step of an intrusion.
-> Try to obtain concrete acces to a system.
-> Always based on a vulnerability (software of human).
-> Based on the previous Discovery and Scanning steps.

Way to gain access
-> Use of Metasploit: direct exploitation of a known vulnerability.
-> Use a simple weakness: password cracking, privilege escalation.
-> Use of spy softwares (keyloggers).
-> Use of an human weakess (social ingeneering).

Maintain access and hide:
-> Post exploitation: use of softwares and tools after gaining access.
-> Add backdoor to gain easier access.
-> Delete traces into backups and logs (footsteps).

Elements of prevention:
-> Use of strict policy passwords.
-> Use of security tols: antivirus, IDS, firewall, ...
-> Keep systems updated.
-> Always verify systems and technology (technology watch, system modifications, ...).
-> Make backup regularly (automated scripts).
-> Keep vigilant.
