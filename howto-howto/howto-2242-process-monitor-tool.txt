ProcessMonitor

Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows file system, 
registry, and process/thread activity in real time. It combines the features of 
two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds a comprehensive 
list of enhancements, including rich, non-destructive filtering, full event 
properties like session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full 
thread stacks with built-in symbol support for every operation, concurrent 
logging to a file, and more. Its particularly powerful features make Process 
Monitor a basic utility in your system troubleshooting and malware scanning 
resource kit.
