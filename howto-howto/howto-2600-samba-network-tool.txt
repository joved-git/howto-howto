Samba | SMB
#BASICS

Samba is an interoperability software that implements the Microsoft Windows proprietary 
SMB/CIFS protocol (more commonly known as SMB) on computers running the Unix operating 
system and its derivatives to share printers and files over a computer network. 

Samba facilitates interoperability between heterogeneous Windows-Unix systems. It allows 
computers on a network to access printers and files on Unix computers. It also allows 
Unix servers to act as a substitute for Windows servers.

Which port does Samba use ?
By default, Samba uses the port number 445.

-> Which tools can I use ?
There are 2 common tools in the Samba world:

-smbmap:    used to displays shares and associated permissions.
$ smbmap -H <server>
>>> displays information about available shares on the <server>.

-smbclient: used to communicate with the Samba server.
$ smbclient --no-pass //<server>/<share>
smb: \> 
>>> if all is OK, we obtain a new SMB prompt.

Here are some useful command:
smb: \> help         obtains the help.
smb: \> ls           lists the content of the directory.
smb: \> get <file>   downloads <file>.
smb: \> put <file>   upload a local <file>.
smb: \> cd <dir>     changes directory to <dir>
smb: \> quit         quits the Samba prompt.

$ smbclient -user=[DOMAIN]USERNAME[%PASSWORD] --password=PASSWORD //<server>/<share>
>>> used to give a username, a domain and a password.

-> How to go deeper
We can use nmap to try to enumerate shares on a server.
$ nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 445 <serer>
>>> this script gives more information (server directory paths, user, ...).
