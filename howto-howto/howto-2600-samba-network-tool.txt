Samba | SMB
#BASICS

Samba is an interoperability software that implements the Microsoft Windows proprietary 
SMB/CIFS protocol (more commonly known as SMB) on computers running the Unix operating 
system and its derivatives to share printers and files over a computer network. 

Samba facilitates interoperability between heterogeneous Windows-Unix systems. It allows 
computers on a network to access printers and files on Unix computers. It also allows 
Unix servers to act as a substitute for Windows servers.

Which port does Samba use ?
By default, Samba uses the port number 445 (or 139).

Config file
/etc/samba/smb.conf
-> Look closely at "read_only", "guest_ok", "valid_users", "* mask" parameters.

-> Which tools can I use ?
There are 2 common tools in the Samba world (smbmap and smbclient):
Let's see them:

-smbmap: used to displays shares and associated permissions.
$ smbmap -H <server>
>>> displays information about available shares on the <server>.

$ smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -H <server>
>>> connection as <user>

$ smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -R <share> -H <server>
>>> specifies a specific <share>

$ smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -R <share> --download <share>/<file> -H <server>
>>> downloads <share>/<file>

-smbclient: used to communicate with the Samba server.
$ smbclient --no-pass //<server>/<share>
smb: \> 
>>> if all is OK, we obtain a new SMB prompt.

Here are some useful command:
smb: \> help         obtains the help.
smb: \> ls           lists the content of the directory.
smb: \> get <file>   downloads <file>.
smb: \> put <file>   upload a local <file>.
smb: \> cd <dir>     changes directory to <dir>
smb: \> quit         quits the Samba prompt.

$ smbclient -user=[DOMAIN]USERNAME[%PASSWORD] --password=PASSWORD //<server>/<share>
>>> used to give a username, a domain and/or a password.

$ smbclient --no-pass //<server>/<share> -c "prompt off; recurse on; mget *"
>>> download all the content of the share without "yes/no" prompt.

-> How to go deeper
We can use nmap to try to enumerate shares on a server.
$ nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 445 <server>
>>> this script gives more information (server directory paths, user, ...).
