Steganography is the technique of hiding sensitive information in seemingly innocuous covering 
media (typically a signal such as text, sound, image, video, etc.), which will not arouse 
suspicion even if it is in plain sight: only a legitimate recipient will know that there is 
information there for them. It is a word from the ancient Greek στεγανός / steganós (“watertight, 
hermetic”) and γραφή / graphế (“writing”). Examples of steganography include The Purloined 
Letter, microdot, invisible ink, digital tattooing or, more innocuously, the coded exchanges of 
banal sentences by couples of artists like Myr and Myroska.

It is distinguished from cryptography which seeks to make content unintelligible to anyone other 
than the person concerned, the two techniques being often combined to eliminate the disadvantage 
of cryptography: a coded text is visibly suspicious and the recipient like the transmitter are 
suspicious.

To take a metaphor, steganography would consist of hiding your money in a statue in your garden 
where cryptography would consist of locking it in a safe, and the combination of the two, hiding 
the safe in a statue.

-> What is possible to do
In steganography, you can hide what you want like: video, audio, image and document. 

-> Some tools to do steganography
* MP3stego: hide into audio.
* S-Tools: hide images into .wav or .bmp.
* Openpuff: hide evrything into everything.

-> An example with COPY
You can use the COPY command of Windows to embed texte into BMP.
Hide:
C:> copy /b littledog.bmp + secret.txt secret.bmp

Retrieve:
Open the secret.bmp file with Notepad and go to the end.

-> An example with S-Tools
Here: http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/books/mos2/zebras.html

Hide:
Launch the tool and just drag an drop image then the txt file.
You can add a password.
Save as the new image.

Reveal:
Open the file the click on Reveal.

-> How to detect a steganography
Some ways:
  -Try to compare original image an those with hidden stuff.
  -Look for visual artefacts and/or blur.
  -Use special tool like Stego-Suite (http://wetstonetech.com/product/stego-suite)
