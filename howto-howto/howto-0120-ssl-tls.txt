Transport Layer Security (TLS) or “Transport Layer Security”, and its 
predecessor the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are 
protocols for securing exchanges via computer network, in particular by 
Internet. 

The SSL protocol was originally developed by Netscape Communications 
Corporation for its web browser. The Internet Engineering standards body 
Task Force (IETF) continued its development by renaming it Transport Layer 
Security (TLS). We sometimes speak of SSL/TLS to designate SSL or TLS interchangeably. 

We will see in this file explanations and important concepts to know
to understand SSL and TLS protocols.

Here are some definitions and concepts:

* SSL means Secure Sockets Layer.

* TLS means Transport Layer Security.

* They are designed to use TCP as a complete secured service.

* SSL and TLS are the same protocols but with different algorithms.

* TLS is a version of SSL because TLS is the successor of SSL.

* TLS allows:
  -Authentification.
  -Confidentiality.
  -Integrity.

* How TLS is functionning ?
* Fonctionnement de TLS:
1. Negotiation.
Two actors are going to negociate to know which algorithme they will use.
Echanged messages are tagged "Client Hello" and "Server hello". This is clearly visible
  into Wireshark.

2. Keys exchange
Actors share their keys and we can authentificate the server.

3. Symetrical encryption.
Public keys are exchanged then symetrical message exchange after.
