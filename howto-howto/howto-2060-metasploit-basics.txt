Basics:
-> Metasploit is a complete environment used to test intrusion. This environment is maintained by Rapid7.
-> It is declined in many version, hence the famous free Metasploit Framework version.
-> It uses some exploits (pieces of code) use to gain access and payloads (pieces of code) launched after the intrusion.

Some definitions:
  exploit = code used to gain access.
  payload = data used to perform some operations (example: create backdoor, clean footsteps, ...).
  shellcode = code (often written in assembly) used to spawn a shell.
    /!\ All shellcode is payload but not all payload is shellcode.
  module = a part of a another software that could be used by the framework. Example: a scan tool.
  listener = a part of Metasploit that listen to incoming connection.

Sensibilisation:
/!\ Metasploit is used to test the vulnerability of systemq.
/!\ Do not use as a tool to obtain access. This is NOT LEGAL !!

Architecture:
-> Metasploit is built around 3 bases.
  Rex: it manages current tasks (protocoles, coding, ...).
  Msf::Core: framework and APIs.
  Msf::Base: simplified APIs, (modules, ...).

Interfaces:
-> Metasploit offers many interfaces.
  msfconsole: gives acces to the Framework using command lines.
  Web interface: only on paid version.
  
On the disk:
-> Some directory and files:
  Locate Metasploit here: /usr/share/metasploit-framework/
  ./config : Framework configuration.
  ./data: data used by exploits.
  ./data/eicar.com: standard file for testing antivirus.
  ./data/wordlists: contains many lists of words (password cracking, id, ...).
  ./db: the database of Metasploit. Do not touch !
  ./documentation: yeah !
  ./lib: libraries used to run Metasploit. The heart of the system.
  ./modules: codes (in Ruby) used to make exploits.
  ./scripts: equivalent to modules. Maybe not yet used today.
  ./tools: modules that can be used without Metasploit.

Local directory:
-> It is here: /home/kali/.msf4

Update Metasploit:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install metasploit-framework
$ cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework
$ sudo gem install bundler

Time to try it:
-> Start Metasploit
$ msfconsole

-> Use a module
msf6> use <exploit>
msf6> use exploit/windows/http/apache_modjk_overflow

-> Look at modules information.
msf6 exploit(<name without 'exploit'>)> show options

-> Quit the software.
$ msf6> quit
