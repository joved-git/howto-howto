Nmap

Nmap is a free port scanner created by Fyodor and distributed by Insecure.org. It is designed to detect open ports, identify 
hosted services, and obtain information about a remote computer's operating system. This software has become a reference for 
network administrators because the audit of Nmap results provides information on the security of a network. It is available 
on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris.

See: https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nmap-services

Usual commands:

$ nmap <hostname>
Scans the first 1000 ports of hostname with:
	> ICMP ping | ARP ping (local)
	> TCP SYN on 443 (HTTPS)
	> TCP ACK on 80 (web server)
	> ICMP timestamp

$ nmap 10.0.2.0/24 | 10.0.2.0-255 | 10.0.2.*
Scans from 10.0.2.0 to 10.0.2.255

$ nmap 10.0.2.0/24 --exclude 10.0.2.1,10.0.2.2,10.0.2.20-30 
Used to exlude some addresses or ranges.

$ nmap -v|vv|vvv|v3 ...
nmap becomes more (and more and more) verbose.

$ nmap -sP ... or nmap -sn ...
nmap only does a ping scan (does not try to scan ports).

-Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery

$ nmap -sS <hostname>
nmap is going to try a TCP SYN connection on <hostname>.

$ nmap -Pn S<hostname>
nmap treats all hosts as online -- skip host discovery (no ping session).

$ nmap -sV ...
nmap performs a TCP SYN scan and display services' version.

$ nmap -sL 10.0.2.0/24
nmap tries to discover hostnames.

$ nmap -p <nm> | -p U:53,T:80 |  -p T:http,https ...
Used to specify a specific port or ports range. For UDP scan, let's give -sU.

$ nmap -F ...
Fast mode. Scans less ports.

$ nmap -O -v ...
nmap will perform an OS detection in verbose mode.

$ nmap -sN|sF|sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans>
> sN: TCP null: all TCP options of the message are set to 0. Normally, could not be possible. This is a disruption try.
> sF: FIN at 1 only. nmap asks for a closing session. This is a disruption try.
> sX: URG, PUSH and FIN are at 1. This is a disruption try.

$ nmap --top-ports <n>
nmap will scan the first <n> most popular ports.

$ nmap -A ...
Means Aggressive too. The toolbox: OS detection, version detection, script scanning and traceroute.

$ nmap -D <decoy1, decoy2 ...> ...
nmap becomes more dicrete by making it appear that the packets come from several machines.

$ nmap -S <ip> ...
nmap will perform an IP spoofing by replacing its own address by <ip>.

$ nmap -sC -v <host>
nmap will perform a scan with default scripts (non intrusive and discrete). List of script is here: https://nmap.org/nsedoc
