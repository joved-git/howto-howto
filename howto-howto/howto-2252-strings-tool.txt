Strings | strings | strings.exe
#BASICS

Working on NT and Win2K means that executables and object files will many times have embedded 
UNICODE strings that you cannot easily see with a standard ASCII strings or grep programs. 
So we decided to roll our own. Strings just scans the file you pass it for UNICODE (or ASCII) 
strings of a default length of 3 or more UNICODE (or ASCII) characters. Note that it works 
under Windows 95 as well.

-> Install strings
Strings can run under Windows or Linux.
On Windows, just go there: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings
On Linux: nothing to do, strings is probably already installed in your distribution.

-> Use it
$ strings <linux executable> [ > strings.txt ]
C:> strings.exe <Windows executable> [ > strings.txt ]
>>> you will see all strings (char strings) that are included into the excutable.

-> Analyze results
Open the strings.txt file with vi or notepad.ex
>>> Try to find interesting things.
