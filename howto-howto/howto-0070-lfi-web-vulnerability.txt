An LFI vulnerability involves exploiting a feature offered by the application to include another 
file located on the system running the application. In some cases, this vulnerability can be 
combined with an attack called “Path Traversal”, which aims to navigate to parent directories in 
order to include any file on the system.

Depending on how the file is included, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute code 
on the server, particularly if the contents of the file are interpreted.

He can also trick other users if he manages to control the content of a file on the server, for 
example using an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. In addition, he can simply obtain sensitive 
information, such as the application’s source code or log files.

Use path into web page:
  https://<webserver>/../../../etc/passwd

-> Prevention
  -Manage page name into the code to prevent inclusion.
