Today, the term virus is generally used to describe a malicious software of any 
sort. At the origin, virus described software with the capacity of auto 
replication from one system to another. Tthe analogy with biology was clear.

Virus are very often inside another software named host software.

Virus is different from worm because the latter is autonomous (no need of host).

-> Different types of virus
-Polymorphic virus: change of signature, comportment, internal structure.
-Batch virus (a .bat file).
-Macro virus (inside Excel, for example).
-Stealer: virus that is used to steal very precises data.
-Crypter: tool that is used to crypt others malicious softwares to avoid
  antivirus detection.

-> Example of a batch virus
This is a .bat file with commands to be executed one by one.
Batch virus is easy to detect (strange icon, extention is .bat).
For example, Virus Canibal is a creator of batch virus. It is written in VB.

-> Example os stealer
Some stealers are written to retrieve password for many applications (web browsers,
games, ...).

-> Example of crypter
An automatic crypter is used to crypt malicious and transform it as indetectable.

-> How to prevent virus
Some technics to detect backdoor.
  -Avoid to use password saver (browser) and use master password.
  -Verify the integrity of all files (hash verification).
  -Make a scan with the anti-virus.
  -Use Virustotal.
  -Use tendencious softwares into sandbox (execution environment):
     https://malwr.com or https://cuckoosandbox.org
  -Keep vigilant (scan before use, don't trust anything).
