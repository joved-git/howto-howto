Cryptography
#BASICS

Cryptography is one of the disciplines of cryptology focused on protecting messages (ensuring 
confidentiality, authenticity and integrity) often using secrets or keys. It is distinguished from 
steganography which causes a message to pass unnoticed within another message while cryptography 
makes a message supposedly unintelligible to anyone other than the appropriate person.

It has been used since ancient times, but some of its most modern methods, such as asymmetric 
cryptography, date from the late 20th century.

We will find in this file several definitions and important concepts to fully understand the notion of
modern cryptography.

Here are some definitions:

* Encryption: it is the action of transforming "clear text" into "encrypted text".

* Decryption: it is the action of transforming "encrypted text" into "clear text".

* Asymetric encryption: we use the same key to encrypt and to decrypt messages.

                     Alice                      |                        Bob
                                                |
MESSAGE + key-#1 = ENCRYPTED_MESSAGEE -> message is sent -> ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE + key-#1 = MESSAGE


* Asymetric encryption: we use differents keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.
We also call it public key encryption.


                            Alice                            |                          Bob
                                                             |
MESSAGE + public-key-Bob = ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE_CHIFFRE -> message is sent -> ENCRYPTED_MESSAGE + privet-key-Bob = MESSAGE

* Encryption by shifting: ROT13 or Caesar algorithm.

* Key: this is information used to realize encryption or decryption.

* Encoding: the way to change the representation of a texte.

* Hash: generate print of a data. This operation is a one-way operation.

* Bob and Alice.
This two characters A(lice) qnd B(ob) are used to create simple scenarios of cryptography.
There are two other characters: Eve for Eaves dropping and Mallory for Malicious.

* trusted third party: third party needed to exchange keys. We use certificats.
Example: Verisign, DigiCert, ...

* Public key infrastructure: infrastructure that coulkd create, manage, deliver and destroy certificats.
To create a certificat, the authority take a public key, generate a new hash and sign it with its own
private key.
