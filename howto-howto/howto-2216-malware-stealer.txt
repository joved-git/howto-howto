Stealer
#BASICS

“Stealer” computer viruses specialize in stealing identifiers (application passwords, 
VPN passwords, etc.), cryptocurrency wallets, session cookies and other data stored 
in particular in Internet browsers. Once exfiltrated, this data is used by 
cybercriminals for fraudulent or malicious purposes.
 
-> How does it end up on your computer?
Stealers are intentionally introduced into counterfeit software (versions not validated 
by legitimate publishers).
The version of the software containing the virus is then distributed via links on various 
mainstream platforms such as social networks or instant messaging. Certain links are 
sometimes even offered in the first results of search engines. Users are invited to 
install extensions promising to improve the performance of a video game or computer, or 
sometimes to benefit for free from software usually paid for. In some cases, the website 
or installer requests disabling the antivirus before downloading and installing the 
infected program, allowing the stealer to go undetected.

-> How to prevent yourself from stealers
Here are the best practices to protect against stealers:
 
  -Do not download or use software, applications and videos that are pirated or of dubious 
   origin which can often contain a virus.
  -Never deactivate your antivirus at the request of software.
  -When faced with a suspicious message (unexpected, alarmist, seductive, etc.), do not 
   open the attachments or click on the links.
  -Regularly update your devices, software and applications.
  -Use strong passwords that say nothing about you and are different for each access to 
   avoid cascading hacks.
  -Two security is better than one: activate double authentication when offered.
  -Do not store your passwords in an insecure manner: post-its, text files, draft messages,
   notes on your smartphone, etc.
  -Use a secure password manager or keychain, preferably stored locally, to keep your 
   passwords secure. You will only have to remember one password to access all of your 
   accounts.
  -Never save your passwords in the browser of a shared computer.
  -Systematically log out of your account after use, to prevent someone from being able 
   to access it after you.
