Code injection | Command injection
#BASICS

Code injection is a computer security exploit where a program fails to correctly process external data, such as user input, 
causing it to interpret the data as executable commands. An attacker using this method "injects" code into the program while 
it is running. Successful exploitation of a code injection vulnerability can result in data breaches, access to restricted 
or critical computer systems, and the spread of malware. 

-> Open the vulnerable Mutillidae site
Mutillidae should be installed in the Win10 machine.
On Kali, open http://<Win10 IP>/mutillidae.
Put Security level at 0 (Hosed).

-> Try an intrusion
1. Choose on the left OWASP 2017 / A1 - Injection (Other) / Command injection / DNS Lookup
    
2. Try the service
  Put "google.fr" than ckick on "Lookup DNS" and note the correct result.

3. Try to launch another command.
  Under Windows the "&" character at the end of a command allows to launch another command.
  Example, type "C\> dir & mkdir tmp & dir and note the result.

  In the "Hostname/IP" box, type [ & dir ].
  >>> you should see the result of the "dir" command.
  In the "Hostname/IP" box, type [ & start notpad.exe ].
  >>> you should see the result of the "dir" command.

-> Make a Deny of Service
Imagine you place 200 "& start notepad.exe " into that box, the Windows machine will become to be over charged.
In the "Hostname/IP" box, type [ & start notpad.exe & notepad.exe ... & notepad.exe ].
>>> the Windows machine is going to be soon unusable.

-> How to prevent yourself
Some advice:
  -In this example, check that the box really contains an IP address or a domain name.
  -Always check the entries of user (type of file, syntax verification, ...).
