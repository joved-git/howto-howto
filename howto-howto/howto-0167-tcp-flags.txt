Drapeaux TCP

In a TCP connection, flags are used to indicate a particular state of the connection or to provide 
additional useful information, for example for troubleshooting purposes or to manage control of a 
particular connection. The most commonly used flags are "SYN", "ACK", and "FIN". 
Each indicator corresponds to 1 bit information.


Types of flags: 

SYN (Synchronization) – It is used in the first step of the connection establishment phase or 
three-way handshake process between the two hosts. Only the first packet from the sender and 
receiver should have this flag set. This is used to synchronize the sequence number, i.e. to tell 
the other end which sequence number it should accept.

ACK (Acknowledgment) – It is used to acknowledge packets successfully received by the host. The flag 
is set if the acknowledgment number field contains a valid acknowledgment number. 
     
FIN (Finish) – It is used to request the end of the connection, that is, when there is no more data 
from the sender, it requests the end of the connection. This is the last packet sent by the sender. 
It releases the reserved resources and terminates the connection gracefully.

RST (Reset) – It is used to terminate the connection if the RST sender believes that something is 
wrong with the TCP connection or that the conversation should not exist. It can be sent on the 
receiver side when the packet is sent to a particular host which was not expecting it. 

URG (Urgent) – It is used to indicate that the data contained in the packet should be prioritized 
and processed urgently by the receiver. This flag is used in combination with the Urgent Pointer 
field to identify the location of urgent data in the packet.

PSH (Push) – It is used to request immediate delivery of data to the receiving host, without waiting 
for additional data to be buffered on the sending side. This indicator is commonly used in 
applications such as real-time audio or video streaming.

WND (Window) – It is used to communicate the size of the receive window to the sender. The window 
size is the amount of data the receiving host is capable of accepting at any given time. The sender 
must limit the amount of data it sends based on the window size announced by the receiver.

SEQ (Sequence Number) – This is a unique number assigned to each segment by the sender to identify the 
order in which packets should be received by the receiver. The sequence number is used in conjunction 
with the acknowledgment number to ensure reliable data transfer and avoid duplicate packets.

ACK (Acknowledgment number) – It is used to acknowledge receipt of a TCP segment and to communicate 
the next expected sequence number to the sender. The Acknowledgment Number field contains the sequence 
number of the next expected segment, rather than the number of the last segment received.

CHK (Checksum) – It is used to verify the integrity of the TCP segment during transmission. The 
checksum is calculated over the entire segment, including header and data fields, and is recalculated 
at each hop along the network path.
