A backdoor is a tool that allows pirates to access discreetly and permanently to 
a system. Pirates can return to that system where they want. A backdoor is often 
used after a hacking but may be the goal of the attack too.

The backdoor could be used with a trojan that is going to install the backdoor.
Backdoors are relatiely easy to detect but they could be very discrete.

-> Different types of backdoor
-Web's Backdoor web: a plugin could be a backdoor.
-System's backdoor: hidden paramaters, hidden account, opened ports,...

-> Example of a backdoor
Tini (tini.exe) was a weel-known backdoor but seems to be detected by all antivurus now.
It was used to open the port (7777) on a Windows machine.
On Kali, you can try to connect to the machine:
  $ telnet <Win10 ip> 7777
  C:\Users\<user>\Desktop>       -> You are connected to the machine.

-> How to prevent yourself from backdoor
Some technics to detect backdoor.
  -On Windows, use 'netstat' to detect opend ports (search for 7777).
  -On Windows, you can use TCPView to see all system's processus, their connections
    and their activities.
  -Make a scan with the anti-virus.
  -Observe the network activity.
  -Keep vigilant (scan before use, don't trust anything).
