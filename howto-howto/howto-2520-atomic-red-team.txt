Atomic Red Team
#BASICS

Atomic Red Team is an open source library of tests designed to test your 
organization's security controls, and this website is designed to help security 
teams better understand Atomic Red Team and the related collection of free and 
open source tools.
This is an utilization of Att&ck for Pentesting and used to detect different 
techniques.

-> What can you find here ?
Go to https://github.com/redcabaryco/atomic-red-team
On the "atomic" folder, you will find all existing techniques.
For a specific Technique, you will have:
  -a README file that describes the Technique, gives the Att&ck
   description and gives Atomic tests. A Atomic test is a concrete
   test used to apply the Technique.

In the Technique folder, you will find source code used for the
Technique and the different Matrices.
     
-> How do that work ?
Here is an example:
1. Click on Atomic/Indexes/Indexes-Markdown/linux-index.md then find
   "discovery" as a pararaph descriptor.
2. Click on "T1033 System Owner/User Discovery" to have different tests.
3. To use all that, go to https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam
   to install and use tool for automatic behaviours.
   Scroll and click on "Installation and Usage instructions" then "Installation"
   on the top-right. Note that you have to install "PowerShell Core on Linux".
   Follow instruction "Installing PowerShell Core on Linux" and install the tool:
     -Install Powershell Core (follow instructions).
     -Install the Framework: 
      PS> Install-Module -Name invoke-atomicredteam,powershell-yaml -Scope CurrentUser
      Confirm A (Yes to all).
     -Install Atomic folders:
      PS> IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam\
          /master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); \
          Install-AtomicRedTeam -getAtomics

4. Use AtomicRedTeam
Suppose you want to execute the Technique T1059.004. Type:
PS> Invoke-AtomicTest T1059.004
>>> All tests are played.
