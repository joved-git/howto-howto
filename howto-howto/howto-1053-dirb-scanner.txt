DirB

DirB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web Objects. 
It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against a web server and 
analyzing the responses.

DirB comes with a set of preconfigured attack wordlists for easy usage but you can 
use your custom wordlists. Also DirB sometimes can be used as a classic CGI scanner, 
but remember that it is a content scanner not a vulnerability scanner.

DirB’s main purpose is to help in professional web application auditing. Specially 
in security related testing. It covers some holes not covered by classic web 
vulnerability scanners. DirB looks for specific web objects that other generic CGI 
scanners can’t look for. It doesn’t search vulnerabilities nor does it look for web 
contents that can be vulnerable.

-> How to pronounce DirB
Just say "dir-bee".

-> How to install DirB
$ sudo apt install dirb

-> How to use
$ dirb
>>> gives help

$ dirb <url> [<wordlist_file(s)>] [options]
You can give worldlist(s) file(s) and options(s).
>>> starts a scan.

-> Hotkeys
During the scan, you can use some hotkeys:
  'n' -> Go to next direcory.
  'q' -> Stop scan.
  'r' -> Remaining scan state.
  
-> Some options
There is no many useful options:
  -a : Define user-agent. 
  -c : Gives a cookie.
  -l : Display directory location when file is found.
  -i : use case-sensitive search.
  -p : utilise un proxy
  -S : Silent mode
  -w : Don't sto pon warnings.
  -x : Add extension file for the scan.
  -X : Add extension string for the scan.
  ...

-> Create your own wordlists
You can use CeWL (prononce "cool") that is here: https://github.com/digininja/CeWL
See: howto-1054-cewl-worldlist-tool.txt
 
-> Use predefined cool lists
