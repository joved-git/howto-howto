Binder

File binders are utility software that allow a user to "bind" multiple 
files together, resulting in a single executable. They are commonly used 
by hackers to insert other programs such as Trojan horses into otherwise 
harmless files, making them more difficult to detect. 
Malware builders (such as keyloggers or stealers) often include a binder 
by default.

-> Polymorphic packer
A polymorphic packer is a file binder with a polymorphic engine. It thus 
has the ability to make its payload mutate over time, so it is more 
difficult to detect and remove.[
