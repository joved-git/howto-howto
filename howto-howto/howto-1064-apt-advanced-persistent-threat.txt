APT

An Advanced Persistent Threat (often abbreviated as APT) initially refers to 
a type of stealthy and continuous computer hacking targeting a specific entity.

The term Advanced Persistent Threat is also commonly used metonymically to 
refer to actors operating APTs (also known as "APT groups").

-> What an APT is exactly ?
There is some confusion over whether the term APT refers to an attack or a 
group but the distinction is not necessarily a significant problem since an APT 
attack is necessarily produced and controlled by a group, and a group takes on 
the character of an APT only if it has produced such an attack.

-> What an APT must be ?
As its name suggests, an APT must be:
  -Sophisticated: The attack is highly technical, allowing it to stealthily 
     penetrate the information systems of sophisticated actors, particularly 
     large companies or governments.
  -Persistent: The attack is capable of remaining in these systems for long 
     periods of time and acting within them or extracting information without 
     being detected.
