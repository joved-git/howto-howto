DTMF coding
#BASICS

A DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) or VF (Vocal Frequency) code is a 
combination of frequencies used for traditional landline telephony 
(except for voice over IP). The frequencies used are specified by the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendation Q.23. These 
codes are emitted when a key is pressed on the telephone keypad and are 
used for dialing telephone numbers (as opposed to older "pulse" 
telephones, which used a rotary dial) as well as for communicating with 
interactive voice servers.

-> How does that work ?
Technically, each key on a telephone corresponds to a pair of two audible 
frequencies that are emitted simultaneously. In this way, eight distinct 
frequencies can be used to code sixteen keys. These frequencies can be 
recognized by electronic devices and are used to create voice servers.

            1 209 Hz   1 336 Hz   1 477 Hz   1 633 Hz
  697 Hz       1          2          3          A 	
  770 Hz       4          5          6          B 	
  852 Hz       7          8          9          C 	
  941 Hz       *          0          #          D 	

-> Examples
Thus, the frequency pair corresponding to 1 is (1209 Hz, 697 Hz), that of 
2 is (1336 Hz, 697 Hz), and so on, up to that of D: (1633 Hz, 941 Hz).
