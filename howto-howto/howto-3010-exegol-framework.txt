Exegol

Exegol is a community-driven hacking environment, powerful and yet simple enough 
to be used by anyone in day to day engagements. Exegol is the best solution to 
deploy powerful hacking environments securely, easily, professionally. No more 
unstable, not-so-security-focused systems lacking major offensive tools. 

Kali Linux (and similar alternatives) are great toolboxes for learners, students 
and junior pentesters. But professionals have different needs, and their context 
require a whole new design.
