* HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP.

* HTTPS uses HTTP and TLS to securize data.

* The goal is to verify the authenticity of the site and encrypt data.

* How does that work ?

  CLIENT generate a premaster secret   
   then sent it to the client        ------------->   SERVER decrypt the premaster secret
 (encrypt with SERVER public key)                                    |

    CLIENT generates a session key                      SERVER generates a session key
                 with                                               with

        CLIENT and SERVER now exchenge data with a symetricla key (the session key)


CLIENT HELLO: the client asks for a secured connection. It gives the list of known algorithms 
              then send a random number (the client random).

SERVER HELLO: the server gives its certificatts public key and the choosen algorithm 
              (example: TLS_RSA_AES256_SHA128). He also calcs a random number 
              (the server random) then send it to the client.
