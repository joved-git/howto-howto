DNS stands for Domain Name System

It is used to convert domain name to an ip address.
DNS uses the port #53 (UDP).
DNS is hierarchized from right to left: com -> facebook -> www

Some DNS fields:
    A		used to retrieve ip v4
    AAAA	used to retrieve ip v6
    PTR		used to invert the search (hostname from ip address)
    MX		used to define the mail server

DNS mechanism:
    A machine asks the DNS for the ip address of a domain.
    The DNS gives immediately the ip (info already in cache) or search for it then give it.

DNS problems:
    Flood: the DNS should not be able to answer. Too much requests.
    Cache poisoning: information are changed.
    Sensible information: DNS must protect its information.

DNS protection:
   Refuse connection to port #53.
   Use DNSSEC (signed DNS).
