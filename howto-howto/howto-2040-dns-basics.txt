The Domain Name System13, or DNS, is a distributed computing service that associates Internet 
domain names with their IP addresses or other record types. By providing a distributed name 
resolution service in the early years of the Internet, around 1985, DNS is an essential 
component in the development of the computer network.DNS stands for Domain Name System

It is used to convert domain name to an IP address.

DNS uses the port #53 (UDP).

DNS is hierarchized from right to left: com -> facebook -> www

Some DNS fields:
    A		used to retrieve ip v4
    AAAA	used to retrieve ip v6
    PTR		used to invert the search (hostname from ip address)
    MX		used to define the mail server

DNS mechanism:
    A machine asks the DNS for the ip address of a domain.
    The DNS gives immediately the ip (info already in cache) or search for it then give it.

DNS problems:
    Flood: the DNS should not be able to answer. Too much requests.
    Cache poisoning: information are changed.
    Sensible information: DNS must protect its information.

DNS protection:
   Refuse connection to port #53.
   Use DNSSEC (signed DNS).
