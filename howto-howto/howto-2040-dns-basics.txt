The Domain Name System13, or DNS, is a distributed computing service that associates Internet 
domain names with their IP addresses or other record types. By providing a distributed name 
resolution service in the early years of the Internet, around 1985, DNS is an essential 
component in the development of the computer network.DNS stands for Domain Name System

It is used to convert domain name to an IP address.

DNS uses the port #53 (UDP).

DNS is hierarchized from right to left: com -> facebook -> www

Some DNS fields:
  A             used to retrieve ip v4
  AAAA          used to retrieve ip v6
  PTR           used to invert the search (hostname from ip address)
  MX            used to define the mail server

DNS mechanism:
  A machine asks the DNS for the ip address of a domain.
  The DNS gives immediately the ip (info already in cache) or search for it then give it.

DNS problems:
  Flood: the DNS should not be able to answer. Too much requests.
  Cache poisoning: information are changed.
  Sensible information: DNS must protect its information.

DNS protection:
  Refuse connection to port #53.
  Use DNSSEC (signed DNS).

DNS root servers:
  There are 13 DNS root servers in the world. Their names are:
	[a...m].root-servers.net a.root-servers.net for aexample. 

  A DNS root server is going to root the request to one of the first level ones. For example, if
  your are searchig for google.fr, the request is going to be root to the first level DNS server
  that manages '.fr'. This server gives the authoritative server for google.fr. The last server
  gives the IP address of google.fr.:w

DNS Prefetch
  The DNS tries to find IP addresses of all links present on one web page.

Cache DND in Chrome:
  Type chrome://cache to see the file that are in the chrome cache.
  Type chrome://net-internals/#dns to see the Chrome DNS cache.

Display the Windows DNS cache:
C:\> ipconfig /displaydns
