ProcessExplorer
#BASICS

Process Explorer displays information about handles and processes opened or loaded 
by DLLs.

The Process Explorer view consists of two panes. The upper window always displays 
a list of currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, 
while the information shown in the lower window depends on the mode that Process 
Explorer is in: if it is in handle mode, you will see the handles that the process 
selected in the upper window has opened; If Process Explorer is in DLL mode, you 
will see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded. Process 
Explorer also has a powerful search functionality that will quickly tell you which 
processes have particular handles open or DLLs loaded.
