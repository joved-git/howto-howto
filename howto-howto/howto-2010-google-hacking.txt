Google hacking is a technique consisting of using a search engine, usually Google, to look 
for vulnerabilities or recover sensitive data. This technique is based on the results of 
the exploration and indexing of websites by the Googlebot robot. It is generally used by 
hackers or crackers. Thus, by entering appropriate requests, it is possible to access pages 
that are not part of the website normally accessible to the public. Some websites contain 
sensitive information such as username, password and other confidential data. A known case 
of Google hacking is the case of passwords and usernames for access to the Wi-Fi network 
which were exposed by malicious users on Google. This information was then used to access 
wireless networks and steal confidential data.Some very useful "Dork" commands to use in 
the google search bar:

"key": search for that exact key or string.

-<word>: the "-" is used to remove a result with <word> inside.

site:<site>: the search is only done on <site>.

intitle:<key>: the search is done with key present onto the title. 
               example: [ site:site.fr intitle:index of ] could give interesting results

allinurl:<key>: gives result with key into the URL.

<number #1>..<number #2> <unity>: search for number #1 and number #2 in the given <unity>.
                                  example: [ 10..35 kilos ] [ 300.500 USD ]

ext:<file type>: only gives result as a file of the <file type> extension.
                 example ext:log OR ext:txt
