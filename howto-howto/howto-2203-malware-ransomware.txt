Ransomware
#BASICS

Ransomware (or extortionware) is a malicious software that takes personal 
data hostage. To do this, ransomware encrypts personal data and then asks 
its owner to send money in exchange for the key that will allow it to be 
decrypted.

Ransomware can also block any user's access to a machine until a jailbreak 
key or tool is sent to the victim in exchange for a sum of money. Modern 
ransomware models initially appeared in Russia, but the number of attacks 
of this type has greatly increased in other countries, including Australia, 
Germany, and the United States.
