Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error in order to obtain 
confidential information, access or valuable assets. In the realm of cybercrime, these 
“human hacking” scams tend to trick unsuspecting users into leaking data, spreading malware, 
or granting access to controlled systems. These attacks can take place online, in person, 
or through other interactions.

Scams that incorporate social engineering exploit the way humans think and act. Attacks that 
rely on this technique are therefore particularly useful for manipulating a user's behavior. 
Once the attacker has identified what motivates a user to act, he is able to deceive and 
manipulate the user effectively.

Additionally, hackers also try to exploit user ignorance. Given the speed at which technology 
evolves, some consumers or employees are unaware of certain threats, such as stealth downloads. 
It is also possible that users are not fully aware of the value of their personal data such as 
telephone numbers. As a result, many users don't know how to get the best protection for 
themselves and their data.

-> How does that work ?
  -Manipulate people to obtain information.
  -Based on uman interactions and influence.
  -Human is weak: this is the key.
  -Difficult to technically detect.
  -Many forms: by phone, by email, dumpser diving, shoulder surfing.

-> how to successfully obtain information
  -Propose gifts.
  -exceptional price.
  -gains.
  -Threats
  -Need help.
  -Use imposture and ignorance.
  -Make him uncomfortable.

-> What abilities to have ?
  -Be a liar.
  -Be able to ask directly.
  -Be a good narator.
  -Be able to change identity.
  -Can communicate non-verbally.
  -Can have a partner.

-> How to recognize such an attack
  -Be careful for the unexpected.
  -Be careful on what is urgent.
  -Be careful to the threats.
  -Be aware of pirates' technics.
  -Verify identidies and information.

-> How to avoid attacks
  -Limit global access or/and information.
  -To record and check access.
  -Be conscious of security policies.
  -Be careful of equipments.
  -Don't trust too easily.
  -Observe suspicious behaviors and signal it.
  -Don't leave too many traces.
