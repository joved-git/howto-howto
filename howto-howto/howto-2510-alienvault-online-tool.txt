-> What is SIEM ?
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a field of computer 
security in which software products and services combine security information 
management and security event management.

-> What is an IOC ?
During a cybersecurity incident, indicators of compromise (IOCs) are clues 
and evidence of a data breach. These digital fragments can reveal not only 
that an attack has occurred, but also, most often, what tools were used in the 
attack and who was behind it.
