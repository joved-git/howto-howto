#BASICS

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of publicly available 
information about security vulnerabilities. The dictionary is maintained by MITRE, 
which is supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of 
standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content 
Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, 
security measurement, and compliance. NVD includes databases of security checklists, 
security related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact 
metrics. 
NVD supports the Information Security Automation Program (ISAP). NVD is managed by 
the U.S. government agency the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 

In the field of computer security, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is 
a standardized system for assessing the criticality of vulnerabilities based on 
objective and measurable criteria. This assessment consists of three measurements 
called metrics: the baseline metric, the temporal metric, and the environmental 
metric. 
The current version of CVSS (CVSSv4.0) was released in November 2023.

Common Weakness Enumeration or CWE is a database created in 2006 of common 
weaknesses. A weakness is a condition in software, firmware, or hardware that can, 
under certain conditions, contribute to the insertion of vulnerabilities.

-> CVE Identifiers
CVE identifiers are references in the form CVE-YYYY-NNNN (YYYY is the year of 
publication and NNNN is the identifier number). For example, the FREAK vulnerability 
has the identifier CVE-2015-0204.

Since 2014, the identifier number for a CVE has been a minimum of four digits and 
can be increased without limit if the number of vulnerabilities in a given year 
requires it (NNNN...N).

-> NVD contents
In addition to providing a list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), the 
NVD scores vulnerabilities using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
which is based on a set of equations using metrics such as access complexity and 
availability of a remedy.

-> CVSS metrics
The final score ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 corresponding to the most critical 
vulnerabilities.

CVSS is built from the base metric, which provides a baseline CVSS assessment, which 
is then weighted with the temporal metric and then the environmental metric. 
These three metrics are defined as follows:
  -The base metric is unique and immutable; it is based on the intrinsic qualities 
     of the vulnerability.
  -The temporal metric is unique but can evolve over time.
  -The environmental metric is multiple and evolves depending on the IT environment. 
     It depends on the IT system in which it is present.
